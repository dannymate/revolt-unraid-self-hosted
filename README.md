# revolt-unraid-self-hosted
Guide for installing Revoltchat on Unraid. As this is not an officially supported means of using Revoltchat support will be spotty. By all means ask questions in Issues. If will answer if I can.

Please look to https://github.com/revoltchat for the official repos. This guide is not associated in any way with the Revoltchat team.

Go the [WIKI](https://github.com/dannymate/revolt-unraid-self-hosted/wiki) for the guide.
